### Omoc Comparer
![Download V0.9](https://github.com/kanehekili/TSVTools/releases/download/V0.9/OmocC.zip)

Compare booked times of a sport gym location owned by old white officals with the real occupation saved on a cloud instance (omoc). 

Basic idea is to compare dates and locations in order to pay only the real time used. Only Xslx files are supported 

Runs on Linux and Windoze.
